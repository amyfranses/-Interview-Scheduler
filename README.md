# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application built using React.js for the front end. It makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a database.

The app allows the users to book, edit or cancel technical interviews between students and mentors from 12pm - 5pm, Monday to Friday.
